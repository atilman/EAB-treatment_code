#### Abstract
Urban forests and trees supply myriad ecosystem services that provide benefits from local (in the case of shade) to global (in the case of carbon sequestration) scales. However, the management of urban forests for the provision of ecosystem services faces several unique challenges due to the complex ownership mosaics that characterize these systems and because many of these services are public goods. As a result, the incentives of private tree owners will typically not align with those of a forest manager whose goal is to optimize the provision of forest ecosystem services across the landscape. This challenge is exemplified by the management of forest pests, such as emerald ash borer (EAB), which threaten the provision of public goods and ecosystems services from urban forests. We study how forest managers can design policies to address forest pest outbreaks and achieve uniform management across a mosaic of ownership types. We develop a game theoretic model to derive optimal subsidies for the treatment of forests pests and find that these policies increase alignment between public and private incentives for forest pest treatment. We then test the efficacy of these policies in mitigating the spread of forest pests with a dynamic epidemiological model for a case study with parameter values drawn from the literature. This model suggests that a combination of optimal subsidies for treatment of privately owned trees with targeted treatment of public trees can be far more effective at reducing pest-induced tree mortality than either approach in isolation.
